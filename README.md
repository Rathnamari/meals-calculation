**Meal and Snack Calculator**

This Python program calculates the total cost based on user inputs for the number of meals, snacks, and juice ordered.
It uses fixed prices: meals at $100 each, snacks at $50 each, and juice at $20 each.
Upon execution, the user is prompted to enter the quantities of meals, snacks, and juice.
The program then computes and displays the subtotal for each item category and the overall total amount payable. 
This tool is designed to provide a straightforward way to estimate costs for meals, snacks, and juice orders based on predefined prices.
